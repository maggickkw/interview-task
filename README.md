# Getting Started

> **Note**:.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

This app currently has a json server connected to it

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run start-dev-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn start-dev-android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
cd ios && pod install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
cd ios && pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run start-dev-ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn start-dev-ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.






# Troubleshooting

If you encounter network issues while runing the app on Windows PC, check your local IP address and change the baseurl on the api-client.ts to that.
to check your ip address on windows

```sh
# Using command prompt
ipconfig -all

```
